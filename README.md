Hi all! Some might have asked me about the weird value results, I'm not sure if the original paper did normlization on lab color value. For the calculation of values in eq14, pls refer to Measuring colourfulness in natural images. For converting rgb to lab, pls refer to the book mesearuing color. FYI, the code I used for converting rgb to lab http://ai.stanford.edu/~ruzon/software/rgblab.html

Sorry that I do not have more time to debug, if you have any suggestions or findings, welcome for leaving a issue or requesting merge!

Thanks.
